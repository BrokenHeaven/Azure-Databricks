- Dec 01: What is Azure Databricks

In previous blogpost we have looked into what Azure Databricks and its' main features, who is the targeted user, and what are  the capabilities of the platform. Where and how to get started?

### 1.Get Azure subscription

If you don't have the subscription yet, get one today at the [Azure web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). It is totally free and you can get either 12 months of free subscription (for popular free services - complete list is available on the link) or get credit for $200 USD to fully explore Azure for 30-days. For using Azure Databricks, the latter will be the one.

### 2.Create the Azure Databricks service

Once logged in to your Azure portal, you will be directly directed to Azure dashboard, which is your UI into Azure Cloud service. In the search box type "Azure Databrick" or select it, if is recommended to you.
